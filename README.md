# GameAPI
Open-source library for creating minigame plugins. This is a full plugin that shall be placed onto your server and hooked from your minigame plugin. It does nothing on its own, but allows other plugins to inter-communicate and it makes it easier for you to create event/minigame plugins.

## Goal
* Provide developers a simpler way of creating mini-game plugins based on arenas.
* Standardize way minigames are created and allow them to communicate cross-plugins.

## Current state
* The library is finished and documented. Plugins using this library are CoreArena, Puncher and AutoPlay (available on SpigotMC).
* It is considered stable and safe to use GameAPI as it has been in production since 2017.
